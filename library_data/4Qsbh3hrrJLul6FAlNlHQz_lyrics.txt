[Verse 1]
Tear me down
Tell me I don't need to fear
Tell me now
Tell me somebody's near
'Cause sirens
Sirens are all I hear

[Verse 2]
They keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
These sirens
Sirens don't come our way

[Chorus]
Or we'll be
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
All run run running away
When sirens they come our way

[Verse 3]
It's raining down
It's raining on someone's fears
Raining down, no
I've heard the rain is the city's tears
But these sirens
These sirens are all I hear

[Verse 4]
And they keep calling out
Keep calling out someone's name
Keep calling out
And all I can do is pray
These sirens
These sirens don't come our way

[Chorus]
Or we'll be
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
When sirens they come our...
All run run running away
All run run running away
Or we'll be
All run run running away
When sirens they come our way
