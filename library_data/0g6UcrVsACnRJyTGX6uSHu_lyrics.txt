[Verse 1]
Well, my temperature is rising, got my feet on the floor
Crazy people knocking cause they want some more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy this place is hot

[Chorus]
And I'm so glad we made it, so glad we made it
You got to gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' everyday

[Verse 2]
Well, I feel so good, everything's getting high
You better take it easy cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I had no work to do
Wait a minute baby, let it happen to you

And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' everyday

[Verse 3]
Well, I feel so good, everything's getting high
You better take it easy cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day, nothing went too good
Now I'm gonna relax, buddy everybody should

And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' (gimme, gimme some lovin')
Gimme some lovin' everyday

Gimme, gimme, gimme some of your lovin', baby
You know I need it so bad
Gimme some of your lovin', baby
