[Verse 1]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

[Chorus 1]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

[Chorus 2]
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

[Bridge]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

Wouldn't it be nice

[Outro]
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
