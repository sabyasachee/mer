[Verse 1]
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms

[Chorus 1]
Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

[Chorus 2]
Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old

[Chorus 1]
Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

[Verse 3]
Someday, I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

[Chorus 2]
Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

[Chorus 1]
Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

[Chorus 2]
Dream lover, until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Till all my lover's dreams come true

[Chorus 1]
Cause I want (yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

[Verse 4]
Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream
