Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo 
(Wop wop wop wop)
Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo 
Walk like a man

Oh how you tried
To cut me down to size
By telling dirty lies to my friends
But my own father
Said give her up, don't bother
The world isn't coming to an end

He said walk like a man
Talk like a man
Walk like a man my son
No woman's worth
Crawling on the earth
So walk like a man my son

Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo 
(Wop wop wop wop)
Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo 

Fine eyed baby
I don't mean maybe
We're gonna get along somehow
Soon you'll be crying
On 'count of all you're lying
Oh yeah, just look who's laughing now

I'm gonna walk like a man
Fast as I can
Walk like a man from you
I'll tell the world
Forget about it girl
And walk like a man from you

Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo
(Wop wop wop wop)
Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo
(Wop wop wop wop)
Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo 
(Wop wop wop wop)
Oo woo-oo-oo oo woo-oo-oo
