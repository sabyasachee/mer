Shoobie doobie doobie doobie doo wop bop (x2)

One fine day
You'll look at me
And you will know
Our love was meant be
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl

Shoobie doobie doobie doobie doo wop bop (x2)

The arms I long for
Will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me
Right by your side
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl

Shoobie doobie doobie doobie doo wop bop
Shoobie doobie doo wop...

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll be waiting and someday darlin'
You'll come to me
When you want to settle down

Oh!

One fine day
We'll meet once more
Then you'll want the love
You threw away before
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl

Ah...
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl (One fine day)
One fine day (Oh yeah)
You're gonna want me for your girl (One fine day)...
