[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
I wish someone explained to me
How losing you was gonna make me feel
Like someone shot a hole in me
And left me out for the wolves to eat

[Chorus]
You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey) It's just not the same
(Hey-hey-hey)

[Verse 2]
And I still drive by your old house
Fight back tears and turn the music loud
Your favorite song, my LCD Soundsystem is always on repeat

[Chorus]
You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey) It's just not the same
(Hey-hey-hey)
I miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey)
And I'd give it all away if I could get you back

[Bridge]
And I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on
I can't hold on

[Chorus]
You're in my blood
You're in my bones
On my mind wherever I go
Can you hear me?
I miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey) It's just not the same
(Hey-hey-hey)
I really miss you today
(Hey-hey-hey) It's just not the same
(Hey-hey-hey)

[Bridge]
And I can't hold on
I can't hold on
And I can't hold on
And I

[Outro]
It's just not the same
I miss you today
