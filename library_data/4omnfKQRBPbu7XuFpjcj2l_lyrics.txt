Losing a star without a sky
Losing the reasons why
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
And I'm not kidding

It's damned if you don't and it's damned if you do
Be true, cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo
Oh, hidy-hidy-hiding, whatcha trying to prove?
By hidy-hidy-hiding
You're not worth a thing

Sew your fortunes on a string
And hold them up to light
Blue smoke will take
A very violent flight
And you will be changed and everything
And you will be
In a very sad, sad zoo

I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see you

How selfish of you
To believe in the meaning of all the bad dreaming

Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing

Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
