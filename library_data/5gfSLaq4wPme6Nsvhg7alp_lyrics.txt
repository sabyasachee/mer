[Verse 1]
She's leaning on my window sill
I'm praying that soon she will
Come on back inside to me
She said she gave me all she could
Loved me better than she should
Now I find it hard to leave

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's hard
It's so complicated

[Chorus 1]
I'm running now
Yes, I'm running now
Ooh, so don't you try to save me

[Verse 2]
It's been this way most every night
'Cause Lord knows how we love to fight
She says I'll never understand
Begging me to let her go
If you never lose, will you ever know
How to be a better man?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She says it's hard
It's so complicated

[Chorus 2]
I'm running now
Yes, I'm running now
Ooh, so don't you try to save me
I'm running now
Yes, I'm running now

Ooh, is it so complicated?
I'm running now
Yes, I'm running now
Ooh, so don't you try to save me
I'm running now
Yes, I'm running now

[Outro]
She's leaning on my window sill
I'm praying that soon she will
Come on back inside to me
