He went away and you hung around and bothered me every night
When I wouldn't go out with you, you said things that weren't very nice

My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
When you see him comin', better cut out on the double
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
You've been spreadin' lies that I was untrue
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
So look out now 'cause he's comin' after you
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)

Hey he knows what you've been tryin'
And he knows that you've been lyin'

He's been gone for such a long time
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
Now he's back and things will be fine
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
You're gonna be sorry you were ever born
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
'Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)

Hey, he knows I wasn't cheatin'
Now you're gonna get a beatin'

What made you think he'd believe all your lies
Wah-ooh, wah-ooh
You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
Wah-ooh, wait and see

My boyfriend's back, he's gonna save my reputation
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)
If I were you, I'd take a permanent vacation
(Hey la, hey la, my boyfriend's back)

Hey I can see him comin'
Now you better start a-runnin'

(Wah-ooh, wah-ooh)
Wait and see!

My boyfriend's back he's gonna save my reputation
(Hey la, hey la my boyfriend's back)
Yeah my boyfriend's back, well he's back now
My boyfriend's back
Well I can see he's comin', so you better get a runnin' all right now

(Fade out)
