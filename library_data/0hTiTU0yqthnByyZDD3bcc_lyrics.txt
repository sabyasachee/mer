[Intro]
Let's get ready to rumble

[Verse 1]
Feel the fire, he's entering the ring
His mindset only know how to win
This Danish fighter will break you in two
You will feel all his power

[Pre-Chorus]
The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance

[Chorus 1]
Feel the power of a warrior
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Let's get ready to rumble
Fight, fight, fight, fight

[Verse 2]
Breaking your record and breaking your bones
Born a warrior with a code
A champion feeding your face with a fist
You will feel all his power

[Pre-Chorus]
The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance

[Chorus 2]
Feel the power of a warrior
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Let's get ready to rumble
Fight, fight, fight, fight
A gladiator's left-hand hook
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Feel the pain tomorrow

[Bridge]
Behold, here comes the son
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one
The call is for a warrior
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground

[Verse 3]
Feel the fire, he's entering the ring
His mindset only know how to win
This Danish fighter will break you in two
You will feel all his power

[Pre-Chorus]
The Viking warrior Mikkel Kessler will now brand his name
In the back of your head, you'll feel the floor again
Unleashing his Hell, you will not even hear the bell
Maybe you're strong, but you don't stand chance

[Chorus 2]
Feel the power of a warrior
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Let's get ready to rumble
Fight, fight, fight, fight
A gladiator's left-hand hook
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Feel the pain tomorrow

[Outro]
Behold, here comes the son
Believe it, he was born to be the chosen one
The call is for a warrior
His name will echo on the sea and on the ground
