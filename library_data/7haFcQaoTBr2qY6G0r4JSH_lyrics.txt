[Verse 1]
(I say a little prayer for you)
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
I say a little (prayer for you)
And while I'm combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now (wear now)
I say a little (prayer for you)

[Chorus]
(Forever) Forever (and ever) yeah
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever (and ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together (together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)

[Verse 2]
I run for the bus, dear
And while riding I think of us, dear (us, dear)
I say a little (prayer for you)
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time (break time)
I say a little (prayer for you)

[Chorus]
(Forever) Forever (and ever) and ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever (and ever) and ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) together (together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)
Nobody but me

[Chorus]
(Forever) Forever (and ever) ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever (and ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) together (together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)

[Bridge]
My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me true
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)
Say you'll love me true (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)

[Chorus]
(Forever) Forever (and ever) ever
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you) Ever
(Forever) Forever (and ever) ever
(We never will part, oh, how I love you)
(Together) together (together) together
(That's how it must be to live without you)
(Would only mean heartbreak for me)
Oh, nobody but me

[Bridge]
My darling, believe me (Believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me true

[Outro]
This is my prayer (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer now, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)
This is my prayer (Answer my prayer, baby)
Answer it right now, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)
Say you'll love me true (Answer my prayer, baby)
This is my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer, baby)
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)
