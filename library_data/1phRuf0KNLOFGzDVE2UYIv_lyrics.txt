In the palace there was hope and joy
In the palace there was hope and joy

See the demon in the night
The shape of it covers the light
Feathers touch upon the skin
When no one else would let you in

Skies are black immensity
Ready for you and me

Baby
You were bound to go crazy
Is it now or just lately
Things are getting a little hazy

A flashing light above me shone
The rain falls like an old song
Take a drug to calm the pain
I know that you feel the same

Crimson moon above tonight
Soon it will be out of sight
Now can you see it through
There is someone that waits for you

Baby
You were bound to go crazy
Is it now or just lately
Things are getting a little hazy

Baby
You were bound to go crazy
Is it now or just lately
Things are getting a little hazy
