[Verse 1]
I wonder what you're thinking
Staring through the rain
Going through our baby names
Your husband thinks you're sleeping
At a motorway hotel
He doesn't know tonight you're flying out of hell

[Chorus]
Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bomb lover, tonight

[Verse 2]
You're turning on your phone now
Your hands begin to shake
I'm just across the harbour bridge you say
I flew out here to tell you
I couldn't hold your pain then
Day by day I waited for your heart to mend

[Chorus]
Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bomb lover, tonight

[Chorus]
Be my rose, growing in the cold
Be my light in the window at home
Be my sun, rising in the sky
Be my time bomb lover, tonight
