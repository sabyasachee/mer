Get up
Time to stop playing the victim
Move on
We've been lying here way too long
Shout out
So tired of all your excuses
Come on
We can prove everybody was wrong
I know what it's like to lose
And I've seen my dreams lie shattered
Like this I trial by fire
And rise from the ashes
(scream and bring it on)
This is my battlecry
What I've lost
I've gained in pride
Going on
Head held high
I control, My life is mine
Nothing worth keeping is given
And nothing worth winning is easy
Failure It's just a beginning
Leading to victory

This is my battlecry
What I've lost I've gained in pride
Going on
Head held high

I control, My life is mine

No one, no one
Knows what I'm made of

Get up
Move on
Shout out
Come on
This is my battlecry

What I've lost I can get back
Going on
Head held high
I control, My life is mine

No one, no one
No one knows what I'm made of
No one was right
I will decide
I'm the author
No one was right
I will decide
I'm the author of my fate
No one, no one
No one, No One
