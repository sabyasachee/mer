[Intro]
I'll wait here
For you
For I'm broken
Down, coming down
This town
For my heart lies

[Verse 1]
Far and away where they took you down
Led them over to your house
Where I'm broken
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Still my heart beats for you

Have become all I lost
And all I hoped for
But I must carry on
Always one
Never broken

[Verse 2]
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Where soul feels
Why I'm broken
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
Woah
I am one
I am one

Break a story of
Peace and love in a future
Bright sacrifice
Came around
Never broken

[Verse 3]
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Travelin' street that I did not know
Wheels like tong to the winter lope
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
I am one
I am one
I am one
