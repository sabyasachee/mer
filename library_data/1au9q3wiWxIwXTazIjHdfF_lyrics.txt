What you say tells me nothing
What's the truth? Give me something
Take me down a road I believe in
Lost the way, lost all reason

Oooh, oooh, give me something

Search the past for redemption
Broken glass, no reflection
Take me to a place I believe in
Lost my way, lost all reason

Oooh, oooh

Through the ruins, trying to save it
Before I fall out, show me somehow I can make it
All that we gave, was it wasted?
Falling down broke, holding one hope
That you make it

Give me something
Give me something
Give me something to hold onto
I've got nothing
Since I lost you
