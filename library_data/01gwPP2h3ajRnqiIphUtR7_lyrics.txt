[Michael]
A buh-buh buh buh

[J5]
A buh-buh buh buh

[Michael]
You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before...

[Jermaine-]
Like "I before E, except after C"

[Michael]
And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you...
[J5]
Teach you, teach you

[Michael]
All about love, yeah!
[J5]
All about love!

[Jermaine-]
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Chorus]
[J5]
A, B, C
[Michael]
It's easy as...
[J5]
1, 2, 3
[Michael]
Or simple as...
[J5]
Do-Re-Mi
[Michael]
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me girl!
[J5]
A, B, C
[Michael]
Easy as...
[J5]
1, 2, 3
[Michael]
Or simple as...
[J5]
Do-Re-Mi
[Michael]
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!

[Tito]
Come on, let me love  you just a little bit!
[Jackie]
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
[Jermaine]
I'm-a gonna teach how to sing it out!
[Michael]
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree

[Jermaine]
But without the roots of love every day, girl...

[Michael]
Your education ain't complete
T-t-t-teachers gonna show you

[J5]
Show you, show you

[Michael]
How to get an "A"!

[J5]
Nyah nyah nyah nyah!

[Jermaine:-]
Spell me you
[J5]
You add the two!
[Jermaine-]
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do!

[Chorus]
[J5]
A, B, C
[Michael]
It's easy as...
[J5]
1, 2, 3
[Michael]
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
[Michael]
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me girl!

[J5]
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3
[Michael]
It's easy, it's like counting up to three
[J5]
Do-Re-Mi, A, B, C
[Michael]
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
[All]
That's how easy love can be
[Michael]
Sing a simple melody, 1, 2, 3, you and ME!

[Bridge]
[Michael]
Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooo oooh!
Shake it shake it, baby, huh!
1, 2, 3, baby, oo ooo!
A, B, C, baby, nah nah!
Do-Re-Mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be

[J5]
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3
[Michael]
It's easy, it's like counting up to three
[J5]
Do-Re-Mi, A, B, C
[Michael]
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

[Jermaine]
I'm-a gonna teach how to sing it out!
[Michael]
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

[Michael]
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

[Jermaine]
I'm-a gonna teach how to sing it out, sing it out, sing it out!
[Michael]
Oh! Oh! Oh, baby!

[Michael]
A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be!
