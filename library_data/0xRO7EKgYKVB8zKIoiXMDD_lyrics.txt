[Verse 1]
Footsteps; without a sound
I'm coming home to you
Snowfall; blankets the ground
It covers the ugly truth
Things that we hide from view

[Chorus 1]
I get tired around this time
I blame it on the cold daylight
Bring your arms around me fast
Warm my bones and fill my glass
God, I hope this year's better than...
The last

[Verse 2]
A candle; burns in a choir
Held with a righteous hand
And I'm reminded... of a silent night
All for a broken man
One I don't understand

[Chorus 2]
I get tired around this time
But I will try to make things right
Bring your arms around me fast
Warm my bones and fill my glass
God, I hope we'll be better than...
The past

[Interlude]

[Chorus 3]
I wake up around this time
Your sweet face will fill my eyes
Wrap me up and hold me fast
Carry on and don't look back
God, I hope this year's better than...
The last
