Sherry can you come out tonight?

(Why don't you come out, come out)
Come out to my twist party
(Come out) Where the bright lights shine
(Come out) We'll dance the night away
I'm gonna make you mine

You'd better ask your mama (Sherry baby)
Tell her everything is alright

(Why don't you come out, come out)
With your red dress on
(Come out) Mmm you look so fine
(Come out) Move it nice and easy
Girl, you make me lose my mind
