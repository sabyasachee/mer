[Verse 1]
Dancing where the stars go blue
Dancing where the evening fell
Dancing in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

[Verse 2]
Dancing out on 7th street
Dancing through the underground
Dancing little marionette
Are you happy now?

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

[Verse 3]
Laughing with your pretty mouth
Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

[Chorus]
