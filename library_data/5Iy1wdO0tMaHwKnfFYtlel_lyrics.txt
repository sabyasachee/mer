[Verse 1]
I write in cursive lines
And I need the help
I miss the shoulder of knowing
Nothing else

[Chorus]
And I will never be
I will never be myself
I will never be
I will never be too well

[Verse 2]
I'd walk the corners
Of my empty mind
But I'm full of darkness
With the loneliest of light

[Chorus]
And I will never be
I will never be myself
I will never be
I will never be too well

[Bridge]
And we'll be fine, there is an end
It hurts to fall back again
And we'll be fine, I promise, oh
It hurts to fall back so low
And we'll be fine, there is an end
It hurts to fall back again
And we'll be fine, I promise, oh
It hurts to fall back so low, back so low

[Chorus]
We will always be
We always be alright
We will always be
We will always be
