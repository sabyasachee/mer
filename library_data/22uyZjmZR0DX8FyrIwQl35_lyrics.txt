[Verse 1: Liza Anne]
Memories running through my bloodstreams
I'm always just a bottle away from you
White fingers clinched around the pictures
Clinched around the hope I'm holding to

[Chorus: Liza Anne]
And, I would wait a thousand years
Just to hear you say my name again
Just to hear it like you meant it that night we touched
And, I would wait a thousand more
Just to find out what you left me for
Just to find out, because I need to know now

[Verse 2: Jake Vroon]
These long days, you're nothing but a story I keep telling
Just to drown out that goodbye
I still see it, you're slamming that old front door
I never thought it'd really be goodbye

[Chorus: Liza Anne & Jake Vroon]
And, I would wait a thousand years
Just to hear you say my name again
Just to hear it like you meant it that night we touched
And, I would wait a thousand more
Just to find out what you left me for
Just to find out, because I need to know now

[Bridge: Liza Anne & Jake Vroon]
And, I'll drink till all my blood is filled with you
Till the whiskey drowns my sorrow
And I'm not thinking about tomorrow
Oh, whatever it takes to feel you again, to feel you again

[Chorus: Liza Anne & Jake Vroon]
And, I would wait a thousand years
Just to hear you say my name again
Just to hear it like you meant it that night we touched
And, I would wait a thousand more
Just to find out what you left me for
Just to find out, because I need to know now

[Refrain: Liza Anne & Jake Vroon]
Memories running through my bloodstreams
I'm always just a bottle away from you
