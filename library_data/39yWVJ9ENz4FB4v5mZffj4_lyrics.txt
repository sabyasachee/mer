{Instrumental}

Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet
Pretty woman... I don't believe you, you're not the truth
No one could look as good as you
Mercy!

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman... That you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me?
*growl*

Pretty woman stop a while
Pretty woman talk a while
Pretty woman give your smile to me
Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah
Pretty woman look my way
Pretty woman say you'll stay with me
Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come with me baby, be mine tonight

Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman don't make me cry
Pretty woman... Don't walk away, hey
Ok, If that's the way it must be ok

I guess I'll go on home it's late
There'll be tomorrow night
But wait! What do I see?

{Instrumental}

Is she walking back to me?
Yeah, she's walking back to me
Oh oh, pretty woman
