[Verse 1]
My heart's beating so hard
Shouldn't be talking so fast
I shouldn't be here at all
Coming up as the sun goes down
Lights in my eyes, alone in the crowd
I only find myself when I lose control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't know how I got here
And my head keeps spinning, spinning
But this is what I live for, all I live for

[Chorus]
I don't know if I'm flying
Don't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
I don't know if I'm flying
Dn't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
Like Icarus

[Verse 2]
I should've been more than this
I was gonna be something big
But I never did anything at all
Coming down as the sun comes up
A new day starts but I just can't stop
Now I know I never really had control

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Lying on the pavement
And the sky keeps spinning, spinning
But this is what I live for, all I live for

[Chorus]
I don't know if I'm flying
Don't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
I don't know if I'm flying
Dn't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
Like Icarus

[Bridge]
Too close to the sun
Too messed up to change
Breaking into pieces
Going down in flames
Lost sight of the lies
If the sky turns black
I'm so scared, so scared
It's too late to turn back

[Chorus]
I don't know if I'm flying
Don't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
I don't know if I'm flying
Dn't know if I'm falling
Don't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
Like Icarus

[Outro]
Burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus
Like Icarus
