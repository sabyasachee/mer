[Verse 1: Jack G]
Thoughts of you and me keep passing by
Like ships in the night, we never collide
Need you here but after all this time
You can't be replaced even if I tried

[Pre-Chorus: Jack J]
I'm looking at her face but I'm seeing you
She's sleeping on your side, what can I do
We should be heart to heart, my mind is on you
I try, I really do

[Chorus: Jack G]
Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
There's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No-one compares to you

[Verse 2: Jack G]
Make it hard for me to love again
Oh, where do I start and when do you end?
Even if I tell myself I can
I know that I'll break before I can bend, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jack J]
I'm looking at her face but I'm seeing you (I'm seeing you)
She's sleeping on your side, what can I do (what can I do)
We should be heart to heart, my mind is on you
I try, I really do

[Chorus: Jack G]
Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
There's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No one compares to you

[Bridge: Jack G]
Every time I think I've found somebody
I just wish that somebody was you
Ooh, there's no way that someone else could make me ever
Feel the same way that you do
No, no one compares to you

No one compares to you
