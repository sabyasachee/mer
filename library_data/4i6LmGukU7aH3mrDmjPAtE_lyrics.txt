[Verse 1]
Forgot about you lover
And the way we used to be
Forgot about the heartache
And the night you set me free
Forgot about you lover
Dancing in the breeze
That's not how dreams are made

[Verse 2]
Forgot about you lover
And the clothes you used to wear
Forgot about the heartache
And the nights we used to share
Forgot about you lover
You left me standing there
That's not how dreams are made

[Chorus]
Where are you know?
Now that my heart it aches
Where are you now?
Now that my heart it breaks

[Verse 3]
Forgot about the sunshine
You're living there I hear
Forgot about the heartache
It slowly disappeared
Forgot about you lover
You faded with the years
That's not how dreams are made

[Chorus]
But where are you know?
Now that my heart it aches
Where are you now?
Now that my heart it breaks

[Chorus]
Where are you know?
Now that my heart it aches
Where are you know?
Now that my heart it breaks

[Verse 4]
Forgot about you lover
And the way we used to be
Forgot about the heartache
And the night you set me free
Forgot about you lover
Dancing in the breeze
That's not how dreams are made
