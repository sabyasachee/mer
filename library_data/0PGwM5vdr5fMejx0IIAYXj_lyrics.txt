[Intro: Michael]
Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Michael]
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Oh baby give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back in your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

[Post-Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Yes I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh ooh baby
(I want you back)
Ya ya ya ya
(I want you back)
Na na na na

[Verse 2: Michael]
Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Oh baby all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(back to your heart)
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go
(let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
Uh-huh

[Bridge: Michael]
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need

[Chorus 2: Jermaine, Michael, and (Jackson 5)]
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
(I want you back)

[Jackie + (Jackson 5)]
Forget what happened then (I want you back)

[Jermaine]
Let me live again

[Chorus 3: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Oh baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

[Jackie]
Spare me of this cause

[Jermaine]
Gimme back what I lost

[Outro: Michael]
Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
Oh! Oh! Oh! I want you back!
