[Verse 1: Passenger]
Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds?
We would light up the sky when we'd fly
You were orange and red like the sun when it sets
I was green as an apple's eye

[Verse 2: Passenger & Birdy]
You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing
Like nothing that you'd ever heard
And I said I loved you with all of my heart when
We were two beautiful birds

[Verse 3: Passenger]
Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds?
We would sing when the morning would come
You were silver and blue like the moon when it's new
I was gold as a summer sun

[Verse 4: Passenger & Birdy]
But one day you asked for a different song
One that I just couldn't sing
I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
Those were the last days of spring

[Verse 5: Passenger & Birdy]
To build a nest we pecked feathers from our chests
Like a book tearing out every page
We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
Into a beautiful cage
