[Verse 1]
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to be?
Tell me how's the way to go?
Tell me all that I should know
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to go?
Tell me how's the way to be?
To evoke some empathy

[Chorus]
Danger will follow me now
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home
Well this tired mind just wants to be led home

[Verse 2]
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to go?
Tell me how's the way to see?
And show me all that I could be
And I'll fall on my knees
Tell me how's the way to be?
And tell me how's the way to go?
And tell me why I feel so low

[Chorus]
Danger will follow me now
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home
Well this tired mind just wants to remain closed

[Bridge]
I don't see clearly
Can't feel nothing, oh
Can you hear me?
And I'll fall on my knees

[Chorus]
Danger will follow me now
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home

And danger will follow me now
Everywhere I go
Angels will call on me
And take me to my home

[Outro]
Angels will follow me now
Lead me to my home
Angels will follow me now
Lead me to my home
