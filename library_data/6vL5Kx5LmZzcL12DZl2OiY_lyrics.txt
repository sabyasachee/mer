Ooooo wah, oooooo wah, ooooo wah, oooooo wah
Ooooo wah, oooooo wah, why do fools fall in love?

[Verse 1}
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

[Bridge]
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame I
Know of a fool, you see
For that fool is me!
Tell me why, tell me why?

[Verse 1]
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

[Verse 2]
Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
For I know it will reach defeat!
Tell me why, tell me why?
Why do fools fall in love?
