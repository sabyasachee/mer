[Verse 1]
See those birds going across the sky
Three thousand miles they fly
How do they know which way to go?
Somehow they always seem to know
They say there's mother nature in everything we see
Wish I had a little mother nature in me
Wish I had a little mother nature in me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, she's never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on
She keep me hanging on

[Verse 2]
See the couple lying on the bus
Falling asleep with so much trust
I wish I had a chance to let them know
Their love is like a flower in the snow
If it's just pheromones then that may be
I wish you had a little pheromones for me
I wish you had a little pheromones for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, I know you're never gonna need me
I'm sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)

[Bridge]
North to south, white to black
When you love someone that don't love you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Yea, it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, she's never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on
