[Verse 1]
It's easier than falling
It's easier than falling
Maybe we should slow it down?
It's easier than talking
It's easier than talking
Maybe you should stick around?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my heart is calling for you
And your heart is breaking into
You give me one half
But it's not enough, I need all of it
You give me one half
But it's not enough, I need all of it

[Chorus]
I need it all or nothing
I need it all or nothing
I need it all
I need it all or nothing

[Verse 2]
It's easier than flying
It's easier than flying
Got me feeling so high right now
It's easier than walking
It's easier than walking
Maybe you should stock around and find out?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my heart is calling for you
And your heart is breaking into
You give me one half
But it's not enough, I need all of it
You give me one half
But it's not enough, I need all of it

[Chorus]
I need it all or nothing
I need it all or nothing
I need it all

[Outro]
I need it all
I need it all
