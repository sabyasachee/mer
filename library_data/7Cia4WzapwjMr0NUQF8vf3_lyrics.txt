[Verse 1]
I want you
Yeah, I want you
And nothing comes close
To the way that I need you
I wish I can feel your skin
And I want you
From somewhere within

[Chorus]
It feels like there's oceans
Between me and you once again
We hide our emotions
Under the surface and try to pretend
But it feels like there's oceans
Between you and me

[Verse 2]
I want you
And I always will
I wish I was worth
But I know you deserve
You know I'd rather drown
Than to go on without you
But you're pulling me down

[Chorus]
It feels like there's oceans
Between you and me once again
We hide our emotions
Under the surface and try to pretend
But it feels like there's oceans
Between you and me

[Outro]
It feels like there's oceans
Between you and me
I want you
And I always will
I want you
