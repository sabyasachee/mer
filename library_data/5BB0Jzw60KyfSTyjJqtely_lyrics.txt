[Intro: Dr. Death Defying]
The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise!

Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na
Na, na na na, na na
Na, na na na na

[Verse 1]
Drugs, gimme drugs
Gimme drugs, I don't need it
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill em' all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator

[Verse 2]
Love, gimme love
Gimme love, I don't need it
But I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an "X" on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me

[Chorus]
(Na, na na na, na na na) From mall security
(Na, na na na, na na na) To every enemy
(Na, na na na, na na na) We're on your property
Standing in V formation
(Na, na na na, na na na) Let's blow an artery
(Na, na na na, na na na) Eat plastic surgery
(Na, na na na, na na na) Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
More, gimme more, gimme more!

[Verse 3]
"Oh let me tell you 'bout the sad man"
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a mad man
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can?
Kiss me, you animal!

[Chorus]
(Na, na na na, na na na) You run the company
(Na, na na na, na na na) Fuck like a Kennedy
(Na, na na na, na na na) I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
(Na, na na na, na na na) Let's blow an artery
(Na, na na na, na na na) Eat plastic surgery
(Na, na na na, na na na) Keep your apology
Give us more detonation

[Bridge]
And right here, right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try now
I'll be your detonator

[Chorus]
(Na, na na na, na na na, na na na na)
(Na, na na na, na na na) Make no apology
(Na, na na na, na na na) It's death or victory
(Na, na na na, na na na) On my authority
Crash and burn, young and loaded
(Na, na na na, na na na) Drop like a bullet shell
(Na, na na na, na na na) Dress like a sleeper cell
(Na, na na na, na na na) I'd rather go to Hell than be in purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode
