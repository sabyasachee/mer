[Verse 1]
Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

[Chorus]
When you go, would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday?"

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you ought to stay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
When you go, would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday?"
Well, come on, come on

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
When you go, would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you like I loved you yesterday?"
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
