[Verse 1]
All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down, my love
Like a cat in a bag
Waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down

[Verse 2]
And I hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down on your side
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

[Chorus]
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

[Verse 3]
But I know I'm on a losing streak
Cause I passed down my old street
And if you want a show
Then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again

[Chorus]
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

[Bridge]
Cause, Baby, if heaven calls
I'm coming too
Just like you said
You leave my life
I'm better off dead

[Verse 1]
All this talk of getting old
It's getting me down my love
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
This time I'm coming down

[Chorus]
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

[Bridge]
Cause baby, ooh, if heaven calls
I'm coming, too
Just like you said
You leave my life
I'm better off dead

But if you want a show
Then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again

[Chorus]
Now the drugs don't work
They just make you worse
But I know I'll see your face again

[Outro]
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord

I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
