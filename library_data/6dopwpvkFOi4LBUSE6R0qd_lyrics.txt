Oh yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman
Wait, Mr. Postman

There must be some word today
From my boyfriend who's so far away
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, a letter for me?

I was standing here waiting, Mr. Postman
So, so patiently
For just a card, for just a letter
Saying he's returning home to me

Please, Mr. Postman
Oh yeah
Please, please, Mr. Postman
Woah yeah

So many days you passed me by
You saw the tears standing in my eye
You wouldn't' stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter

Please, Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, oh yeah, in your bag for me
You know it's been so long
Yes, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

You better wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, you better wait a minute
Please, please, Mr. Postman
Please check and see
Just one more time for me

You better wait, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Please, Mr. Postman
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better

Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, please, Mr. Postman
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Woah
