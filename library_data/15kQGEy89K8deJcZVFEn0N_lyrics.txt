[Verse 1: Kelsea Ballerini]
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah-eah-eah

[Verse 3: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Pre-Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

[Bridge: Kelsea Ballerini & Andrew Taggart]
My friends say no-o, no-o-o
Then they don't know
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know
No-o, no-o-o
No, no

[Outro: Kelsea Ballerini]
And I say no, oh, oh
And I say no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't know, oh
