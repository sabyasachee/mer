Ooh, his old heart of mine
Been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away
I fear you've gone to stay

Lonely nights that come
Memories that flow
Bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake
To show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing
If I'm coming or going
But I

I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
Yes, I do (yes, I do)

These old arms of mine
Miss having you around
Makes these tears inside
Start falling down

Always with half a kiss
You remind of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feeling
Cause my head starts spinning
'Cause I

I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
Yes, I do
Yes, I

Ooh, I try hard to hide
My hurt inside
This old heart of mine
Always leaves me crying

The way you're treating me
Leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day
Gone for the week now

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it
'Cause I

I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you
This old heart, darling, is weak for you
(Darling I) I love you
(Weak for you) This old heart, darling, is weak for you
(Darling I) I love you
(Weak for you) Yes I do
(Darling I) Yes I do
(My, oh my)
(Darling I) I love you
