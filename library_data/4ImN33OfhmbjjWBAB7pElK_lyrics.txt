They never taught us how to love
So we use our pain to comfort us
And we never practice what  we preach
Instead we find someone else to teach
We try not to see with our eyes
And fill our plates with dozens of lies
We try so hard to keep it in
We turn away from what lies within

We are splintered
And we are rotten
Deep within the walls that we've forgotten
All the answers to all our problems
Lie within the one who tries to dodge them

Weâ€™re so afraid to be alone
So we hoard our pain and call it home
They never taught us how to look inside
Only how to run and how to dry our eyes

We dig ourselves in too deep
How many of us die and pretend to live
We stop the life from leaking in
When we turn away from what lies within

We are splintered
And we are rotten
Deep within the walls that we've forgotten
All the answers to all our problems
Lie within the one who tries to dodge them

We are splintered
And we are rotten
Deep under the floorboards we've forgotten
But all the answers to all our problems
Lie within the one who tries to dodge them
