[Verse 1]
Nothing goes as planned
Everything will break
People say goodbye
In their own special way
All that you rely on
And all that you can fake
Will leave you in the morning
But find you in the day

[Chorus]
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh, you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh, you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out

[Verse 2]
Everything will change
Nothing stays the same
And nobody is perfect
Oh, but everyone's to blame, yeah
All that you rely on
And all that you can save
Will leave you in the morning
And find you in the day

[Chorus]
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh, you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh, you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out

[Interlude]
No, I cannot get you out
No, I cannot get you...
Oh, no, I cannot get you out
No, I cannot get you...

[Bridge]
Everything is dark
It's more than you can take
But you catch a glimpse of sunlight
Shining, shining down on your face
Your face
Oh, your face

[Chorus]
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out
Oh, you're all I taste
At night inside of my mouth
Oh, you run away
Cause I am not what you found
Oh, you're in my veins
And I cannot get you out

[Outro]
No, I cannot get you out
(Oh, you're in my veins)
And I cannot get you out
Oh, no, I cannot get you...
