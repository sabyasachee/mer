Come, husk your limbs
To my floor
Bone sucking stones, her coming storm
Under the lights you went
Chemical ashes head down
Heart on a diamond thread
Fennel and lashes went down

(Ooh)

Young star, haunted lynx
Ring of silver (oh)
I want your bones, inside my bones
Under the lights you went
Wearing our chimes we bled out
Fennel and lashes wet
Heart on a diamond thread (ah)

You're making me sweat- sweat- sweat my love down deep into your bones
You're making me sweat- sweat- sweat my heart down deep into your soul
I can't take it

(Ooh)

You're making me sweat- sweat- sweat my love, down, deep into your bones
You're making me sweat- sweat- sweat my heart, down, deep into your soul
I can't take it

I can't take it
