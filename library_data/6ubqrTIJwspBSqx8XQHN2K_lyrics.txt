I'm so bored with
This world that spins around me
Used to make me dizzy
And I'm so tired of these boys that hang around me
Used to drive me crazy

A little Mayhem never hurt anyone
When I'm gonna get some?
A little bedlam til I'm coming undone
Where I'm gonna get some?
A little Mayhem never hurt anyone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
A little bedlam til I'm coming undone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?

Moving tensions
Once we're in a spiral
I'm awaiting to unravel
Distant motives
Drive me in a circle
I'm dying to untangle!

A little Mayhem never hurt anyone
When am I gonna get some?
A little bedlam til I'm coming undone
Where am I gonna get some?
A little Mayhem never hurt anyone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?
A little bedlam til I'm coming undone
How am I gonna get some? Get some? Get some?

I wanna feel the rave house
I wanna hear the uproar
A little pandemonioum
I know I'm not the only one
I wanna be thrown away

I wanna feel the walls shaking
I wanna feel the walls shaking
I wanna feel the walls shakin, shakin, shakin, shakin, shakin Ohhh

Looking for some mayhem
Need a little mayhem
Ohhh
Need a little mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Looking for some mayhem
Yeah
Yeah
Need a little mayhem
Want to hear some mayhem
Yeahhh
