[Verse 1]
I never thought it could be
And there was nothing that could make me let you go
'Cause you were my wildest dream
But your open hands would become my enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to ask myself if I was right or wrong
But blinded by the making up that I knew all along

[Chorus]
But if I was made to love you
Then how can you bring me pain?
And if I was made to love you
Then how come we're here again?
And why does it hurt so bad?
If I was made to love you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
It didn't take long to find
That scars can't be covered from all the words you cry
The sorrow you hid behind
And all of your tears won't be able to justify

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to ask myself if I was right or wrong
But blinded by the making up that I knew all along

[Chorus]
That if I was made to love you
Then how can you bring me pain?
And if I was made to love you
Then how come we're here again?
And why does it hurt so bad?
If I was made to love you
