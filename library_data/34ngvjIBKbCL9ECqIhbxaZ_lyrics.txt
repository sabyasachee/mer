[Verse 1]
Oh no, tonight I find it hard to swallow
The bed is made and I feel hollow
My friends suggest that I should take it slow
I took it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I sweat it out, I'm not okay, I'm shaking on the floor
I lay awake and I count the days and I wait beside the door

[Chorus]
For love, I only want you next to me
Sweet love, how long before you hurt for me?
Hurt for me, do you hurt for me?

[Verse 2]
Blackout the night before inside of my mouth
Too much it's what I like to do now
My mind explodes and I can't make it out
I'm falling down

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your face in blurry shades and I reach out for your hand
All your ways I can't explain but I want to understand

[Chorus]
My love, I only want you next to me
Sweet love, how long before you hurt for me?
Hurt for me, do you hurt for me?

[Bridge]
I sedate my mind with hope of your return
Just enough to weigh me down
I can fake my heart and I love to watch it burn
But it knows you ain't around

[Chorus]
My love, I only want you next to me
Sweet love, how long before you hurt for me?
Hurt for me, will you hurt for me?
