[Intro]
Now, I know that I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your...

And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change...

[Verse 1]
So many bright lights, they cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding, I get so weak
A love that's so demanding, I can't speak

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

[Verse 2]
Can you see, my eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here, on the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror, and I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding I'm incomplete?
A love that's so demanding, I get weak

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

[Post-Chorus]
These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me
I say

[Bridge]
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

(How can I see, I see you lying)
'Cause I see you lying next to me
(How can I see, I see you lying)
With words I thought I'd never speak
(How can I see, I see you lying)
Awake and unafraid
(How can I see, I see you lying)
Asleep or dead

I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead

[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home

[Outro]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world, alone
Honey, if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
