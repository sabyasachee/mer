We know full well there's just time...
So is it wrong to dance this line?
If your heart was full of love
Could you give it up?

Coz what about, what about angels...
They will come, they will go and make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

How unfair, it's just our luck
Found something real that's out of touch
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
Would you dare to let it go?

Coz what about, what about angels...
They will come, they will go and make us special
Don't give me up
Don't give me up

Coz what about, what about angels...
They will come, they will go make us special

It's not about not about angels, angels
