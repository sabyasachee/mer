[Verse 1]
Times are changing and
Times are moving
And everything i ever knew
Will never be the same

[Verse 2]
I lie awake in the same old way
But there's something in the air
And it's calling me in
And I know I'll follow
I don't think about it anymore

[Verse 3]
As the summer ends I think of our last goodbye
It's hard to imagine the seasons
Without you by my side
And I know this winter is going to be especially cold

[Chorus]
Like the river
I roll along
Today, i'm here
Tomorrow, i'm gone

[Verse 4]
I saw a group of birds passing by
They were moving like a school of fish in the sky
I hold onto that moment and keep it close to me
Cause it's times like that that I feel so small
And I'm humbled
And I feel one with it all
And my roots dig deep
And my branches are so high

[Chorus x2]
Like the river
I roll along
Today, I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone

[Verse 5]
I've walked and i've walked
And i still have so far to tread
I just need to keep that flock of birds inside my head
And that fluttering inside my chest

[Chorus x2]
Like the river
I roll along
Today, I'm here
Tomorrow I'm gone
