Fast car and slicked back hair
Hundred miles going anywhere
I know I'm different that's what they say
I'd give it all just to feel the same

I was running now I'm drowning
What's my fuckin' name?
I've been dancing with the devil
As the music's played
But I can't hear the music till I see her face
Till I see her face

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

I know this can't be right
Running toward the dead of night
In my shoes I know what you'd say
Turn around and face the light of day

I was hiding from myself
What a fucking shame
And the devil left me stranded
When I called his name
Nothing hit me harder till I saw her face
Till I saw her face

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Windows down now I can breathe
And make sense of everything
I can see the moment it went wrong
I'll rewind, replay and pause
I'll keep you there
Inside my arms

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here
Wish you were here
