One, two, one, two
One, two, three, four

Don't listen what your girlfriend says
She reads those magazines
That say you failed the test
You don't have what she needs
I slither like a viper
And get you by the neck
I know a thousand ways
To help you forget about her

That bitch can eat her heart out

Love bites but so do I, so do I
Love bites but so do I, so do I
(Love bites)

My lips are pale and vicious
You're foamin' at the mouth
You've suffered in the darkness
I'll suck the pain right out
So come and taste the reason
I'm nothin' like the rest
I'll kiss you in a way
You'll never forget about me

That chick can eat her heart out

Love bites but so do I, so do I
Love bites but so do I, so do I, so do I

It checks you in and kicks you down
And chews you up and spits you out
It messes with your sanity
By twisting all your thoughts around

They say it's blind, they say it waits
But every time it seals your fate
Now it's got you by the balls
It won't let go until you fall

I was down and out, got up
I said, "Hey love, I've had enough"
I've felt pleasure without pain
My soul you'll never tame

Love bites but so do I

Love bites but so do I, so do I
Love bites but so do I, so do I, so do I
(Love bites) But so do I, so do I
Love bites, love bites
