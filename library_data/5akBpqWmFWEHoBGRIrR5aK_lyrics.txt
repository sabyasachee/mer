[Verse 1]
Where it began
I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along

[Pre-Chorus]
Hand, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would

[Verse 2]
But now I look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when holdin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you

[Chorus]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
Oh no no

[Outro]
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
