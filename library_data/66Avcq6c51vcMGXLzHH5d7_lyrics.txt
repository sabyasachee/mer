[Verse 1]
A Georgia rain just kissed my lips
I live, I live for moments like this
Steady your aim, girl
I know you won't miss
I wish that you would aim for the blood of my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know what you're doing
You know that it hurts
The worst, but I stand through the pain of it all
I'll follow you down to the edge of this earth, earth, earth

[Chorus]
In the name of love, I'll follow you
You fit me like a glove when I'm inside of you
And if nobody's there, it's cool, I'll die for you
In the name of love, I'll kill for

I'll kill for you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes, they could cut through diamonds and steel
For real, they're sharper than the blade in your hand
They tell me you're strong, but they don't tell me what you feel
I feel there's something that you want me to hear
It's coming in loud and clear
You know what you want, what you want, what you want

[Chorus]
In the name of love, I'll follow you
You fit me like a glove when I'm inside of you
And if nobody's there, it's cool, I'll die for you
In the name of love, I'll kill for

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones, break my bones
But bullet holes, you know they can't hurt me
Invincible, unbreakable, unstoppable
I'll show you who's worthy
You grab the gun, I'll take the wheel
Fuck the world, my love is real
Fuck the world, my love is real
Fuck the world, this love is real

[Verse 3]
Shit's real, I need you to aim straight for my heart
And if you're gonna miss then hit my head and leave a permanent scar
You're fatal but I love who you are
Be my death or my forever
You're my little bloodfeather
Bloodfeather

[Chorus]
In the name of love, I'll follow you
You fit me like a glove when I'm inside of you
If my bodyâ€™s dead and cold, I died for you
In the name of love, I'll kill for
