[Verse 1]
Well, I'm standing here freezing, inside your golden garden
Got my ladder leaned up against your wall
Tonight's the night we planned to run away together
Come on Dolly Mae, there's no time to stall
But now you're telling me that ah

[Chorus]
I think we better wait until tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right
So, until tomorrow, goodnight

[Verse 2]
Oh, Dolly Mae, how can you hang me up this way?
On the phone you said you wanted to run off with me today
Now I'm standing here like some turned-down serenading fool
Hearing strange words stutter from the mixed-up mind of you
And you keep telling me that ah

[Chorus]
I think we better wait until tomorrow
Got to make sure it's right
So, until tomorrow, goodnight
See if I can talk to this girl a little bit

[Verse 3]
Oh, Dolly Mae, girl, you must be insane
So unsure of yourself leaning from your unsure window pane
Do I see a silhouette of somebody pointing something from a tree?
CLICK, BANG
Oh, what a hang
Your daddy just shot poor me
And I hear you say, as I fade away

[Outro]
We don't have to wait until tomorrow
It must not have been right, so forever, goodnight
Do I have to wait, do I have to wait
It's a drag on my part
Don't have to wait, don't have to wait
