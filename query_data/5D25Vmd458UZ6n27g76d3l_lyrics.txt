[Intro]
Have faith in me
Cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe
So cling to what you know and never let go
You should know things aren't always what they seem

[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

[Verse 1]
I'm going crazy
Cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So we'll pretend it's alright (pretend it's alright)
And stay in for the night
Oh what a world
I'll keep you safe here with me (with me)

[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

[Refrain]
They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall
They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall

[Bridge]
Have faith in me

[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go (go), and I never did (did)
I said I'd never let you fall (fall) and I always meant it (meant it)
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

[Outro]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
